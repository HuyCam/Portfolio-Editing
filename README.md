# Portfolio Editing
This is a portfolio template that user can edit text content, add images, change the background color and add social media link to custom your own portfolio right on the spot. 

I use jQuery to make the site the most interactive as possible. When you open the default.html file to open up the portfolio site, please follow the instruction to edit the site.
